This assignment was to re-create the homepage for Travel-Fly. For this assignment, the goal was to set up a website that can be made responsive, set up a fixed navigation, and move elements in a container. The homepage that I created has to look like the prototype on the Travel-Fly XD file, with the appropriate content and design as well.
